# Movie Embeddings Generator README

## Overview

The Movie Embeddings Generator is a Python-based application designed to enhance movie search functionality within a MongoDB database by utilizing semantic embeddings. By generating and utilizing embeddings from movie plot descriptions, the application allows for contextually rich, semantic searches that go beyond simple keyword matching. This approach leverages the Hugging Face API for embedding generation and MongoDB's powerful vector search features.

## Features

- Secure management of sensitive credentials using environment variables.
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- Use of the Hugging Face API to generate semantic embeddings for text.
- Implementation of MongoDB vector search to enable semantic search based on plot descriptions.

## Prerequisites

- MongoDB (local installation or access to an Atlas cluster)
- Python 3.6 or later
- An active Hugging Face account with an API token

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Preparation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
Install the required Python dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the project root directory, copying the structure from .env.example. Populate it with your MongoDB connection string, Hugging Face API token, and embedding service URL:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_CLIENT_URL=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_api_token>
EMBEDDING_URL=<embedding_service_url>
Generating Embeddings
To generate embeddings for the movie plots:

Uncomment the relevant section of the script that iterates through the movie collection and generates embeddings.
Ensure your MongoDB database and collection names are correctly specified in the script.
Run the script to populate your database with embeddings.
Performing Semantic Searches
Modify the query variable in the script to your search term of interest. Run the script to execute a semantic search against the movie plots in your database. The script outputs the top matching movies based on the semantic similarity of their plots to the query.

Usage
sh
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
Replace <script_name> with the name of the Python script you wish to run.
